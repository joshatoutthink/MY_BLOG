I work for a marketing agency, called Outthink. One of my roles in the company is to build our clients websites, with wordpress.  Recently I built a plugin, that adds on to another plugin called [beaverbuilder](https://wpbeaverbuilder.com) _(a drag and drop page builder)_. My plugin basically just adds a place to write some documentation, while building out the website. I was able to quickily build out this plugin, because I was able to go back and look at old code that I had written, that added on to this same plugin.  

Several months earlier I had spent weeks working on a plugin to add to this page builder plugin. Diligently reading documentation, tutorials, and source code.  I spent such a long time trying searching the internet for solutions to my problem. Eventually I was able to build what I needed to.

Now several months later, I have forgotten almost competely the API,s or how to build on to the beaverbuilder plugin. However, since I knew I had done built things similar to I consulted with my code first before I had done any googling to figure out how to do what I wanted to do. It made building this plugin quick and easy. I eventually still had to look up documentation, scan source code, but it was not nearly the same experience as before. Instead of taking a week to build the plugin it took hours. 

One thing that I wish I had done was document this process in a blog post. While sifting my code was better than sifting through all of google.  It would have been better if I had written it down like I am doing now. Documenting or writing a blog post about your discovery process is also great for many reasons.
- Sometimes easiest code, and code comments to understand is code that you have written.
- It helps others, and gives back to the community.
- Builds up your web presence, making you more desireable to employers.
- You will more likely to remember without having to look back at documentation, because you've written it down.
  
## Conclusion
The extra work of writting it down can be a lot. However, the benefits, if you stick with it, will make you a faster and better developer. Often the best way to learn a topic is to teach the topic. The next time you spend all day debugging something or learning a new api document it, so you can help others and also yourself.
