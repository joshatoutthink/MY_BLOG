I am a front-end developer at Outthink, a marketing agency. One of my roles is building our client's websites on wordpress. For some clients, I will use Beaverbuilder, _(a drag and drop page builder)_, to streamline the builld process. However, while drag and drop page builders can speed along a build, they can also cause a heachache. Working within Beaverbuilder's API can be restrcitve, and finding creative solutions or adding customizations can take valuable time.  

Recently, I built a plugin for beaverbuilder that would allow the user to add documention, or footnotes, to a component. This relatively simple plugin usually would have been a time consuming project. This time however, it was a quick project. I was able to go back and review code that I had written for beaverbuilder.    

Several months ago, I spent weeks working on a global color plugin. I spent tedius hours diligently reading documentation, tutorials, and source code. I spent such a ridiculous amount of time trying to search the internet for solutions to my problem. Eventually - I was able to build what I needed.

Now several months later working on my new documentation plugin, I had forgotten almost competely the <!-- Beaverbuilder --> API, and how to work with their functions. But this time, I had a jumping off point. I had done the teduis work with my global color plugin, I now simply had to consult my old code. While I eventually had to look up documentation and scan source code, it was not nearly the same experience as before. Instead of taking a week to build the plugin, it took meer hours. 

One thing that I wish I had done differently was document this process in a blog post. Sifting my code was better than sifting through the casm of google. It would have been even easier if I had written it down in a simple, easy to read blog format. Documenting or writing a blog post on your discovery process is great for many reasons:

- Sometimes the easiest code to understand, is code that you yourself have written.
- It helps others -it gives back to the community.
- Documenting in a blog post can build your web presence, making you more desireable to employers.
- The very act of writing out your process can help solidify your memory.
  
## Conclusion
The extra work of writting it down can seem like too much work. However, the benefits, if you stick with it, will make you a more effieciant and productive developer. Often the best way to learn a topic, is to teach the topic. The next time you spend all day debugging or learning a new API, document it. You can help others, and also yourself.
