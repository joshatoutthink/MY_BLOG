## This is my first blog post.
This post is going to be about this blog, and why I created it. This essentially is a portfolio website with a blog.  I want a place to keep track of my journey as designer and developer.  

### Projects
I plan to document major and small projects that I create.  From Codepens that try explore new css and js API's, to full Client projects that accomplish specific goals.  I plan to document them all. Besides a place for people interested in seeing my design and dev abilities, can see my work, its also a place for me to keep track of my progress as I grow.
### Blog
The other part of this site is the blog. I will write on any technology, or API I am exploring, documenting my learning progress. While, I hope this will be helpful to others, this is also for me to reference, when I forget what I have learned.To all those who are learning, and who do not have a blog. I highly recommend in joining me, and blogging what you learn so you can learn better and help others on their journey.
