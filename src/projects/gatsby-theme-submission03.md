I created a theme exploring gatsby themes.  They allow you to install functionality, that abstracts away some of the beginning tedious work of creating pages and layout.  I took a preexisting theme and styled it and added easy to change components, and added my own documentation in a demo site, saying how to use this theme and also gatsby-themes in general.  Allowing the user to quickly build and learn, while using my theme.
